A first person 3D view to collect ores on a planet. Ores were modeled by Cynthia in blender.

Concept: A game designed to take place in the future in a distant universe. As science is advancing more resources and reasearch is needed for technology to continue to grow. So, you've been assigned to gather resources on different planets. 

Future addons/ideas (not implemented yet): The game is centered around helping the envoirnment and society back at home, as well as helping expand the space base you return to. (hub world) After each successful mission, the space base would show visual change by being upgraded and/or getting bigger. 

Levels can be added as different missions on a a wide variety in different planets and envoirnments.
There can also be a nice menu to show the planet with summary and stats of the envoirnmental climate, types of ores, gravity, etc. Before going on the mission. Different missons can range from collecting ores, plants etc.

There is supposed to be a ship AI that would talk through space helmet screen. They would have a personality and talk to the player. The AI can be muted on and off by a button that acts like a switch.

Other things to work on would be a fleshed out opening cutscene.

Immediate things to work on next: Fixing the progress bar to corespond to the ore collecting. Also should add a "time limit" via oxygen tank being depleted.
